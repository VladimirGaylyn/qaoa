|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Approximation Ratio** | 0.637 ± 0.570 | 2.069 ± 5.798 | ~0.8-0.9 | v3 (more stable) |
| **Feasibility Rate** | 16.5% ± 1.1% | 0.0% ± 0.0% | ~20% | v3 (v4 failed) |
| **Best Solution Probability** | 0.004% ± 0.01% | 0.000% | >0.1% | v3 (non-zero) |
| **Circuit Depth** | 7 | 15 | 8-10 | v3 (shallowest) |
| **Convergence** | 27 ± 8 iterations | 48 (no convergence) | ~30 | v3 (faster) |
| **Execution Time** | ~8s | ~19s | ~10s | v3 (fastest) |

## Key Findings

### v3 Advanced - Working Baseline
✅ **Strengths:**
- Achieved 16.5% feasibility rate (close to theoretical maximum for random sampling)
- Circuit depth of 7 meets hardware requirements
- Converges in reasonable iterations
- Fast execution (~8s per run)

❌ **Weaknesses:**
- Extremely low best solution probability (0.004%)
- High variance in approximation ratio
- Feasibility below target 20%

### v4 Enhanced - Failed Attempt
❌ **Critical Failure:**
- 0% feasibility rate across all 20 runs
- Penalty multiplier too strong (200.0 base penalty)
- SPSA optimizer didn't help with convergence
- Doubled circuit depth without benefits

### v5 Balanced - Design Goals
🎯 **Target Improvements:**
1. Balanced penalties: base_penalty = 30.0 * sqrt(n_assets/10)
2. k-hot initialization: theta = 2 * arcsin(sqrt(k/n))
3. Post-processing amplitude amplification (1.5x boost)
4. XY-mixing for Hamming weight preservation

## Problem Analysis

### Why Low Best Solution Probability?

The extremely low best solution probability (0.004% in v3) indicates:

1. **Search Space Size**: With 20 qubits, we have 2^20 = 1,048,576 possible states
2. **Feasible Subspace**: Only C(20,5) = 15,504 states satisfy the budget constraint (1.48%)
3. **Optimal Solutions**: Typically 1-10 truly optimal solutions (0.0001-0.001%)

### Theoretical Limits

- **Random Sampling**: Would give ~1.48% feasibility
- **Our Result**: 16.5% feasibility shows QAOA learns the constraint
- **Best Possible**: With perfect amplitude amplification, could reach ~20-30% feasibility

## Recommendations

### Immediate Improvements
1. **Fix Penalty Scaling**: Use v5's balanced approach (30-50 base penalty)
2. **Better Initialization**: Implement proper k-hot state preparation
3. **Post-Processing**: Apply amplitude amplification to boost good solutions

### Future Research
1. **Adaptive Penalties**: Dynamically adjust during optimization
2. **Quantum-Inspired Classical**: Use QAOA structure with classical optimization
3. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine quantum circuits with classical post-processing

## Conclusion

While v3 provides a working baseline with reasonable feasibility (16.5%) and shallow circuits (depth 7), the extremely low best solution probability (0.004%) indicates the algorithm struggles to concentrate amplitude on optimal solutions. The v4 attempt to improve this through stronger penalties catastrophically failed with 0% feasibility.

The balanced v5 approach with proper initialization and amplitude amplification represents the correct direction, targeting:
- ~20% feasibility (achievable)
- >0.1% best solution probability (10x improvement)
- Circuit depth ≤10 (hardware feasible)

**Verdict**: v3 remains the best working implementation, but requires the balanced improvements from v5 to achieve practical performance for real quantum hardware.
