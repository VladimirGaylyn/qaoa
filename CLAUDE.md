# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) project repository. The codebase is currently in initial setup phase.

## Development Setup

As the project develops, add specific setup instructions here such as:
- Python version requirements
- Virtual environment setup
- Dependencies installation commands

## Project Structure

The repository structure will be established as the project develops. Key directories and files to be added:
- Source code organization
- Test structure
- Configuration files

## Common Commands

Commands will be added as the project development progresses:
- Build/installation commands
- Test execution commands
- Linting and formatting commands
- Running the application

## Architecture Notes

Architecture details will be documented as the codebase is developed, including:
- Core algorithm implementations
- Module dependencies
- Key design patterns used

## Development Guidelines

Project-specific guidelines will be established based on the chosen technology stack and frameworks.
